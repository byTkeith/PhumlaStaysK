# Phumla-Kumnandi-bookingSystem

## About 
The Phumla Kamnandi Hotel group, an emerging empowerment initiative formed last year, has entrusted our team—comprising myself and Siyabonga Popela—to oversee the computerization project for their array of small hotels across South Africa. With around 30 distinct Phumla Kamnandi Hotels operating independently within the group, our task involves implementing a phased approach to enhance their operational systems.

## Project Scope and Objectives

As part of our assignment, we've been tasked with the initial phase of the computerization project. This involves the completion of a singular iteration focusing on the development and implementation of the Guest Booking function. Our primary goal in this phase is to create and integrate this function, addressing specific use cases to improve the guest booking process within the Phumla Kamnandi Hotels.

We're dedicated to enhancing the efficiency and guest experience within these hotels, aligning with the overarching objectives of the Phumla Kamnandi Hotel group's modernization efforts.
